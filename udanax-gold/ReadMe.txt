UdanaxGold2Java - Udanax-Gold
-----------------------------

This directory holds the source code to Udanax-Gold as released by
XOC. It is used by the translator application to generate approximate
Java translation which I have called abora-gold.

A number of files are present here as it has been a struggle to find a
complete set of Udanax-Gold source files. All the following files are
originally from XOC but gained from a number of locations. I believe
all are supplied under XOC open-source licence which is based on the
very liberal MIT licence.


- udanax-top.st

This the principle released Udanax-Gold source.
