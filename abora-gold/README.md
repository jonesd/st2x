# UdanaxGold2Java - Abora-Gold

Abora-Gold is just my name for the combination of auto and manual
translation of the Udanax-Gold open-source released by XOC. It is
*NOT* compilable but my prove useful for non-Smalltalk users who are
interested in reading the Udanax-Gold source code.

See ../translator/README.md for generating Java source.

There are two source directories present.

- src is the location for the code which I manually translated from
C++ for PrimArray and subclasses - this is broken. Additionally there
are a number of place-holder classes for classes which haven't seen to
have been released yet by XOC

- src-gen is the location of the classes auto-translated from
Smalltalk by my translator. It will only be present if you have run
the translator.
