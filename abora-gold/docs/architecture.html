<h1>Keyed Collection API</h1>
<b>boolean store(Position key, Heaper value)</b>
Store the value it the specified key. Return true if that key already existed in the
collection
<b>void introduce(Position key, Heaper value)</b>
As store, but assumes that no matching key is currently being stored in the collection.
Throw an exception if there is already a matching key.

<b>boolean wipe(Position key)</b>
Remove the association with a matching key. Return true if an entry with matching key
was found in the collection.
<b>void remove(Position key)</b>
As wipe, but must be a matching key in the collection, will throw an exception if there
isn't.

Often there will be overloaded methods related to the key, to support the general Position
type, and also the more efficient int type.


<h1>SetTable</h1>
Dictionary from key to values. Holds a SharedPtrArray, of which each element is a
TableEntry. A TableEntry is a single-linked list of key and value pairs.

A hash of the key is used to determine the index of the SharedPtrArray, holding the
head TableEntry.

The SharedPtrArray is an optimization to allow sharing of fragments of data structures
between different SetTable's. If a modification is to be made, a new SharedPtrArry is
created and populated with copies of all TableEntry lists it holds. This is triggered by
prefacing any modification with a call to the aboutToWrite method, and if the SharedPtrArray
is being shared with any other Tables, this copying beviour will be triggered.

BucketArrayStepper is used to step over the elements of the table.

TODO Does wipeAssociation work? It seems to hold onto previous entries after an aboutToWrite,
so contaminating the shared data structure?

TODO BuckArrayStepper never gets finalized/destructed, so keeps a share onto the SharedPtrArray
of the SetTable.

<h1>TableEntry</h1>
Internal element stored in a SetTable.

TableEntry is the abstract base class of entries, and there are other subclasses.

<ul>
<li>HashIndexEntry</li>
<li>HeaperAsEnty</li>
<li>IndexEntry</li>
<li>PositionEntry</li>
</ul>

Matching is used to determine if the current entry is the one that is being looked for
in the table. If no match is made, the next entry could be examined. Matching can occur
for both the key and the value.

TableEntry's are created through one of a pair of create factory methods.
<ul>
<li><b>TableEntry.makeIntegerVar(int index, Heaper value)</b> - </li>
<li><b>TableEntry.make(Position key, Heaper value)</b> - </li>
</ul>
